#### Special Traits

- **Area of Influence:** The bloodsuckle has an area of influence of 30ft around it. In this area it ignores the stated reach of its attacks. The area is also difficult terrain.
- **Attack Count:** The bloodsuckle has a set attack count for each phase of combat. It starts with 6 attacks. It can use an attack to do an opportunity attack instead of using its reaction. Every 5 damage it takes each round reduces the attack count by 1. Every 5 HP healing it receives it gains an attack.
- **Telegraphed Actions:** At the end of its turn, the bloodsuckle spawns as many tentacles in the *Area of Influence* as its attack count. These vanish or appear if the attack count changes. It also enwraps each target in tentacles it plans to use *Blood Drain* on. After it attacks with a Tentacle, it disappears.
- **Combat Phases:** The bloodsuckle gets stronger the more charmed targets it loses. Every time a threshold is reached, it goes into the next phase (see below), which will immediately take effect.
