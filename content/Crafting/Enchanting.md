Simple rules for enchanting until I can think of something more interesting.

You can use an enchanting tome to enchant a mundane item into a magical one
This takes 8 hours.
You can only create an item of the rarity or below from the tome.
The item must fit the use case of the enchantment (Can't have a +1 desk as a magical weapon)
