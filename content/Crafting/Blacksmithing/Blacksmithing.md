Needs **Smithing tools** and a forge

## Ingredients
Metal Ingots and processed wood, leather, etc.
10 pounds of ore into a single 1 lb. ingot in a process taking 8 hours.

**Templates**

A template covers a type of weapon or armor; for example, a longsword. Once you know the template for something, you know the template for it regardless of what you make it from or what other properties you might add. Without the template for a type of object, any crafting roll made to make it is made with disadvantage.

Templates can be innovated or taught, and you automatically learn a template once you've crafted something using it three times.

**Techniques**

Techniques are a bit more complicated, and fall into two categories. Techniques for working with metal, which, once known, apply to all instances of working with the metal regardless of what you are working on. 
All base materials have two difficulties associated with them: 
- The base difficulty that is applied if you know the technique
- A higher penalty difficult applied if you don't know the technique. This difficulty is added to the default difficulty (DC) of the crafting roll of a template.

There are additional optional techniques that can be applied to add modifiers to a weapon that it would not normally have. These are _optional_ and increase the difficulty of the craft, but make it a special item with unique nonstandard properties. These techniques cannot be applied without knowing them. They must be taught, learned, or innovated before they can be used, and even once known add difficulty to the craft (there is no penalty modifier for these, because they cannot be used without having the technique known)
