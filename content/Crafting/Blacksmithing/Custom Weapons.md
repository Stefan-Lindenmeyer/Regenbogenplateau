Part of the point of being a blacksmith is break free of the shackles of conformity and be able to create whatever you want. This still has to contend with balance of the game, but fortunately weapons in D&D have a template which can be used to create new weapons while still falling into the guidelines of what a D&D weapon should be.

##### Material Cost

When crafting something created from the Guide:

- Base material is 1 ingot.
- Add +2 ingot if it is two handed.
- Add +3 ingots if it is heavy.
- Add a short haft if is a hafted weapon, or a long haft if it has the reach property.

##### Difficulty:

When crafting something created from the Guide:

- Base difficult is 4.
- Add +1 for it being a custom weapon.
- Add +1 if it is martial.

It's innovation difficulty is 25 for the Template.

##### Time & Checks

- Base crafting time is 2 hours & 2 checks.
- Add 1 hour for martial.
- Add 1 hour for two-handed.
- Number of checks equals number of hours of crafting time.

# Weapon Template

At first glance, it seems that the weapon selection in 5e D&D is quite limited, but with a little knowledge of the system, you can largely expose that template that builds those weapons, and from there, well, the local blacksmith is the only limitation to the weapons you can find!

#### Weapon Creation Template

To create a weapon, you take a d6, go through five steps to determine the final damage and properties of the weapon.

##### Step 1: Select one of...

|Property|Modifier|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Simple|--||
|Martial|**+d2**|Becomes martial weapon.|

##### Step 2: Select one of...

|Property|Modifier|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Light|**-d2**||
|None|--||
|Versatile|--|+d2 when wielded with two hands.|
|Two-Handed|**+d2**||

##### Step 3: Select all that apply...

|Property|Modifier|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Reach|**-d2**||
|Finesse|**-d2**|Free if the weapon is Light or has no other properties.|
|Thrown|--||
|Heavy|**+d2**|Requires two-handed.|

##### Step 4: Set Damage Die/Dice...

You can divide your damage die into smaller dice that equal the same total. For example, a d12 can become 2d6 or 3d4.

##### Step 5: Select Damage Type

|Type|Effect|
|---|---|
|Slashing|--|
|Piercing|--|
|Bludgeoning|--|

##### Notes:

- Dividing the damage die will raise the average damage by 0.5, but is considered equal by the template (as can be seen with Greataxe and Greatsword)
- Thrown can be ranged weapons instead of melee weapons (example: Dart)
- The DM can waive the restriction on Heavy property requiring Two-Handed property.
- Finesse is odd to account for that Rapiers were designed to be too strong.

#### Not-so-common Weapons.

Taking the formula, we can now make all the missing weapons of the game world. While these weapons should not necessarily be assumed to exist and are not starting gear, perhaps you can craft them, convince the local blacksmith to give your idea a go, or find these as loot early in your adventures - the strongest of these weapons tend to still fall below the threshold of Uncommon, but some will be more powerful for some builds than common starting gear weapons.

Below are some results of the template. Note that all weapons (even if they are created by the template) only count under existing weapon proficiency at the discretion of your DM.

##### Simple Weapons

|Weapon|Cost|Damage|Weight|Properties|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Finesse Spear|1 gp|1d4|2 lbs.|Finesse, Versatile (1d6).|
|Sturdy 10-Foot Pole|1 sp|1d6|9 lbs.|Reach, Two-handed.|
|Chain|5 gp|1d4|10lbs.|Reach.|
|Heavy Greatclub|3sp|1d10|15 lbs.|Two-handed, Heavy.|
