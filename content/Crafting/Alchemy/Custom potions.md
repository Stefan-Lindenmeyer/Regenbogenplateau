#### Ingredient Effects
Each ingredient has an effect on it's own. If used as part of a recipe, these effects are ignored, but these effects determine what an ingredient does when being added to a **Custom Potion**.

For Curative, Reactive, and Poisonous effects, these are standard effects. For exotic effects, each ingredient has it's own effect. Almost anything can be an exotic ingredient at the discretion of your DM, though many things will may not have much effect, or the effect you hoped for.

##### Basic Effects

**Curative:** When brewed into a potion, a Curative ingredient restores 1d4 hit points per rarity to someone that consumes the potion. This means that a common curative restores 1d4 hit points, and a legendary curative restores 5d4 hit points.

**Reactive:** When brewed into a potion, a Reactive ingredient will cause the potion to deal 1d4 fire damage anything within 5 feet of the potion vial breaking that fails a Dexterity saving throw of a DC equal to 8 + the alchemist's tools proficiency + alchemy skill.

When mixed with a Poisonous ingredient, the damage becomes acid damage.
