Modified version of [Taming a creature](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/voc9he/rules_for_taming_creatures/)
(Changed to work in faster paced campaigns where downtime is days at most not weeks)

**Resources.** A character must have made contact with a creature they wish to tame. A character must spend 8 hours and at least 1 gp in research, equipment, shelter, feed, and other expenses to have a chance of taming the creature.

**Resolution.** After 8 hours, the character makes three checks: Wisdom (Animal Handling), Wisdom (Insight), and an Intelligence (Arcana), (History), (Nature), or (Religion) check determined by the creature type. The character gains a +1 bonus on the checks for every 8 hours and 1 gp spent, up to a maximum bonus of +5.

If none of the checks are successful, the creature escapes causing various sorts of damage. The character must pay a fine equal to 10 gp x the creature’s CR (If applicable) or suffer other repercussions like reputability decrease, exhaustion, bodily damage (whatever fits with the creature).

If only one check is successful, the creature escapes without causing noteworthy damage.

If two checks are successful, the creature is not tamed, but is still contained, and the DC for future attempts decreases by 1, up to a maximum decrease of -5.

If all three checks are successful, the character succeeds in taming the creature, which will become an ally of the character.

The DC for the checks is 11 + the creature’s CR.
