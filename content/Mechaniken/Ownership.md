## General Rules

Every entity has a plane they belong to, this is usually the plane they entered the area from but can be changed through means like magic, gods or ownership transference etc.
If an entity is inside the area and looks through the boundary, it will see the plane it does not belong to.
Every entity has a center of mass.
If this center of mass crosses the boundary, the entity gets transported to the realm they belong to.
If part or the whole of the body would be inside a solid object or entity after transporting, the object or entity with less mass will get pushed to the nearest empty space where it would fit and takes ***1d8 bludgeoning damage for every foot*** traveled this way.
### Soul Entities
Soul Entities cannot be owned by other Soul Entities. Their ownership cannot be transferred except if they give up their souls and become objects. This does not mean they die, just that their soul left their body and they are no longer in control of the soul.

### Object Entities
Object Entities are free entities.
This means their ownership can change through the influence of Soul Entities.
The approximate rules for this are as follows:
- Only one Soul Entity can own an Object Entity
- While a Soul Entity touches an Object Entity with lower mass, it takes ownership of the Object Entity
- An Object Entity belongs to the same plane as the last Soul Entity that took ownership of it
- As long as an Object Entity is in possession of a Soul Entity, it follows the rules of the Soul Entity
- An owned Object Entity does not add its mass to the Soul Entity
- If an object approximately travels with the same speed in the same direction as a Soul Entity and is connected through a chain of similar Object Entities to the Soul Entity, it counts as owned by this Soul Entity
- If an Object Entity is not fully in the overlapped area, a Soul Entity cannot take ownership of it
- If an Object Entity is a magically infused apparatus, that can move without direct control, the ownership belongs to the Soul Entity that infused it with magic, but it is counted as separate from the Soul Entity. This means it can cross the boundary independent of its owner.
