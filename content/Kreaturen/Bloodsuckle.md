Special Traits

- **Area of Influence:** The bloodsuckle has an area of influence of 30ft around it. In this area it ignores the stated reach of its attacks. The area is also difficult terrain.
- **Attack Count:** The bloodsuckle has a set attack count for each phase of combat. It starts with 6 attacks. It can use an attack to do an opportunity attack instead of using its reaction. Every 5 damage it takes each round reduces the attack count by 1. Every 5 HP healing it receives it gains an attack.
- **Telegraphed Actions:** At the start of the first round and the end of its turn, the bloodsuckle spawns as many tentacles in the *Area of Influence* as its attack count. These vanish or appear if the attack count changes. It also enwraps each target for it plans to use *Blood Drain* on in tentacles. After it attacks with a Tentacle, it disappears.
- **Combat Phases:** The bloodsuckle gets stronger the more charmed targets it loses. Everytime a threshold of freed charmed targets is reached, it goes into the next phase (see [[#Combat Phases]]), which will immediately take effect.

Actions

- **Tendril**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 30ft., one target. _Hit_: The target is [grappled](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Grappled) (escape DC 13), pulled within 10 ft. and injected with mind-altering sap. Such targets must succeed on a DC 14 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) save or become [charmed](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Charmed). Charmed targets are released immediately but compelled to remain near the bloodsuckle and submit to its Blood Drain ability. A charmed creature may make a new save each time it takes damage from a source other than Blood Drain. *Crit:* Immediately use Blood Drain if charmed with 1d4.
- **Raking Limb**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. _Hit_: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. A raking limb can be spawned outside of the *Area of Influence*, but only one on each creature in its blindsight range. *Crit:* Tentacle does not disappear.

Bonus Actions

- **Blood Drain**. The bloodsuckle can drain blood from each of its [charmed](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Charmed) and telegraphed hosts in its *Area of Influence* dealing 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per round and healing itself the same amount.
